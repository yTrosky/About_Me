        /n/nI love fish.
        /n/nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean
        /n/nFun fact is that I have a several aquariums and also a river
        /n/nI like fishing, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Some fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        /n/nAnd sometimes I even go fishing
        /n/nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch sometimes.
        /n/nOnce, when i was camping in Canada, and very hungry, i even caught a large salmon with my hands.
        /n/nI'll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        /nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though. \n\n
